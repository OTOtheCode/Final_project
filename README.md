Hello everyone.
Here is our final project. Hospital's management consolar application. 
By interacting with code through console, operator can chose what organizational unit he/she wants to enter:
1. Registration desk
2. Clinic Management dashboard
3. Accounting dashboard.(in development)

Each of these has/will have dedicated functions:
1. from Registrarion desk dashboard operator can register patients, view history, schaldule meeting with doctor, select services for patients etc.
2. from clinic management dashboard. operator can monitor staff operations, view personal on duty, add/remove staff members, create and assigne task to staff memeber.
3. from accouting dashboard. accountatns can gather infromation about salaries, procedures, costs, monthely incomes etc. 

all information is saved in CSV files as tables. Also from these csv files we take what we need for separate functions. Information in files are updated, removed, appended. etc. for this task was used pandas.

Tried to use OOP as much as possible, but still not eanough: There a lot of fields to be finished like password authentications, validations, file managers. I think  through more work it will be possible to make it much more presentable and functional. 


About future of this IDEA (kind of solution):

After thinking about this managment soft. There came idea, in the future, to change it into modular managment tool, that can be used by any kind of businnes, just by chosing correct modules. For instanse if we leave intact staff management and accounting part. we can  remove registration desk for patients and change it let's say IT support Help desk module, or cleaning service client registration module or any other.

Of course before we reach that stage, it will take hours and hours of learning/coding, and fixing hundreds of mistakes.
